              We built the company that we'd want to do business with. We hope you do too.

            <div class="chapter">1</div>
            <h4>Useful is forever</h4>
              <p>Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
            <div class="chapter">2</div>  
            <h4>Great service is everything</h4>
              <p>We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
            <div class="chapter">3</div>  
            <h4>Clarity is king</h4>
              <p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
            <div class="chapter">4</div>    
            <h4>Our customers are our investors</h4>
              <p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
          </div><!--column1-->

            <div class="column2">
            <div class="chapter2">4</div>   
            <h4>The basics are beautiful</h4>
              <p>We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.
            <div class="chapter2">4</div>   
            <h4>No hidden fees or secret prices</h4>
              <p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
            <div class="chapter2">4</div>   
            <h4>Software should be easy</h4>
              <p>Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
            <div class="chapter2">4</div>   
            <h4>Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>
              <p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
